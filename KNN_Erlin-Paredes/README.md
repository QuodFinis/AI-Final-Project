Digit Recognition using K-Nearest Neighbors:

This Python script utilizes the OpenCV library to perform digit recognition using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The purpose of the code is to recognize digits from a dataset (digits.png) and then test the recognition on another dataset (test_digits.png).

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using:

pip install opencv-python

Usage:

Place the digit dataset image (digits.png) and the test digit dataset image (test_digits.png) in the same directory as the script.
Run the script.

Description:

Loading Images: The script reads the digit dataset (digits.png) and the test digit dataset (test_digits.png) using OpenCV. The images are loaded in grayscale.

Data Preprocessing: The digit dataset is split into 50 rows, and each row is further split into 50 cells. These cells are then flattened and stored in a list. Labels are assigned to each cell based on the digit they represent (0 to 9).

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): The KNN algorithm is trained using the digit dataset cells and their corresponding labels. Then, the test digit dataset is flattened and converted to a NumPy array. The trained KNN model is used to predict the digit for each test cell.

Results: The script prints the predicted results for the test digit dataset.

Note
Ensure that the dataset images are appropriately formatted, and the script paths are adjusted if the images are located in a different directory.

This script serves as a basic example of digit recognition using KNN. Further optimizations and enhancements can be made based on specific requirements.
